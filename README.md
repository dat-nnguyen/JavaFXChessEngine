# ♞Java Medieval Chess Engine

A fully functional, object-oriented Chess Engine built from scratch using Java 17 and JavaFX. This project features a robust MVC architecture, a custom Minimax AI opponent, and a polished medieval pixel-art interface

## 🚀 Features

### **Core Engine**
* **Complete Chess Rules:** Handles complex moves including **Castling** (King/Queen side), **En Passant**, and **Pawn Promotion**.
* **Move Validation:** Validates legal moves for all pieces, preventing illegal actions (e.g., moving a pinned piece, moving into check).
* **Game States:** Detects **Check**, **Checkmate**, and **Stalemate** conditions accurately.

### **Artificial Intelligence**
* **Minimax Algorithm:** Implements a recursive tree-search algorithm to determine the best move.
* **Heuristic Evaluation:** Scores board states based on material weight, mobility, and positional safety.
* **Concurrency:** Runs AI calculations on a background thread (`JavaFX Task`) to prevent UI freezing during deep searches.

### **User Interface (GUI)**
* **JavaFX Implementation:** Built with a clean, responsive UI using `StackPane`, `BorderPane`, and `GridPane` layouts.
* **Asset Management:** Features a "Medieval Pixel Art" theme with video backgrounds (`.mp4`) and custom sound effects.
* **Quality of Life:**
    * **Visual Feedback:** Highlights legal moves and selected pieces.
    * **Game Timer:** Functional countdown clock with "Flag Fall" logic.
    * **Menus:** Interactive Main Menu, Game Setup (Mode/Difficulty/Time), and Pause/Game Over screens.

## 🛠 Technology Stack

* **Language:** Java 17
* **Framework:** JavaFX 22.0.2 (Controls, FXML, Media, Graphics)
* **Build Tool:** Maven
* **Testing:** JUnit 5, Mockito
* **Design Patterns:**
    * **MVC:** Separates `Board` (Model), `BoardPanel` (View), and `GameEngine` (Controller).
    * **Strategy Pattern:** Used for AI Move selection (`MoveStrategy`).
    * **Factory Pattern:** Used for creating Moves (`MoveFactory`).
    * **Builder Pattern:** Used for constructing immutable `Board` states.
    * **Singleton/Static Utilities:** Used for `SoundManager` and `ImageCache`.

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

The project follows strict **Object-Oriented Principles**:

* **`entities` Package:** Contains the core logic.
    * `Board`: Immutable state container representing the 64 squares.
    * `Piece`: Abstract class with subclasses (`Rook`, `Pawn`, etc.) defining movement vectors.
    * `Move`: Represents a state transition. Subclasses handle special logic (`CastleMove`, `PawnJump`).
* **`gui` Package:** Handles the presentation layer.
    * `GameEngine`: The central controller managing game loop, input handling, and AI triggers.
    * `BoardPanel` & `SquarePanel`: Renders the grid and handles click events.
* **`core.ai` Package:**
    * `MiniMax`: The decision-making algorithm.
    * `StandardBoardEvaluator`: The scoring system for board states.
